## Usage
Download all the files. Locate the 'htdocs' folder in your computer's drive and unzip the files there. Via xampp, run both the Apache and MySql servers and navigate to PhpMyAdmin. Once there, create a new database and name it "skl_db". Import the skl_db.sql file from the project directory. Finally, type in 'localhost/skl/' in your browser. 

## Dev Log

This was made in partial fulfillment to my integrative programming course. Prof gave us a selection of systems to develop but I chose to the blog platform as it was a system that I am familiar with and one where i can freely express my creativity and design language (plus it was the most challenging among the choices and I enjoy suffering). I never really liked bootstrap and woudld've preffered other libraries such as tailwind. But since one of the system's requirements was to use the damn thing I had no choice but to give it a shot. Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad. I lament the fact that the styling is limited but I like the reponsiveness.
